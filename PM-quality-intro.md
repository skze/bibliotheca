## Introduction

*What Is Project Quality Management?*

Project quality management is the process of defining quality standards for the deliverables of a project, as well as the quality assurance measures to guarantee those standards are met.

Within this context the term "quality" represents a combination:

* risk management, keeping track of tasks, timelines and resources
* verifying deliverables against requirements/specs
* and stakeholder management

> Project Quality Management processes include all the activities of the performing organization that determine quality policies, objectives, and responsibilities so that the project will satisfy the needs for which it was undertaken. [4]

Modern *quality management* and *project management* are complementary activities. Both emphasize stakeholder satisfaction and minimizing deficiencies, wastes and guaranteeing correct delivery of project outputs.

One key aspect is that to ensure project quality it is necessary to - meet customers expectactions - ensuring that the project meets the planned and agreed outcomes - nothing more, nothing less :)

## Project

**Project Steps**

There are 3 main phases to the project-quality-tracking process. These include 1) planning, 2) control and 3) assurance.
Certain references include additional phases, example:
* phase before planning called 'standards'
* phase after assurance called 'improvements'

**Purpose**

The main objective of project quality management is ensuring that the team is working in the right direction to achieve the set goals. 
It focuses on quality aspects - which can be measured, tracked and analyzed.

Project managers further define these for their project through a quality management plan (QMP). A quality management plan 
is a document that helps project management teams establish quality planning, quality control and quality assurance procedures.

**What is Quality**

Quality is measured by comparing the attributes of a product or service and the expectations. It is a 
subective comparison because quality is often a selling poing.

**Quality Standards**

Provide requirements, specifications, or guidelines that can be used to ensure that products, processes pr services are fit for achieving the desired outcome.
This should be set at the beginning of the project, in order to make sure the team and stakeholders understand exactly what they are.

**Quality Planning**

The actions of the project manager or the team to establish a process for identifying and determining exactly which standards of quality are relevant to the project.
Quality planning should define a quality plan which includes a set of periodic audits to check if all the necessary procedures are being followed, including regular check-ins and discussion with stakeholders

Here are some questions to guide the planning process:

* *What outcomes do my custmers want?*
* *What does quality looks like for them?*
* *How can I meet their expectations?*
* *How will I determine if the quality measure will lead to project success?*


**Quality Assurance (QA)**

Evaluating if your project is moving towards delivering a high-quality service or product. This is a 
quality procedure step that checks that stakeholders are getting the excactly product previously agreed upon.

**Quality Control (QC)**

This step involves monitoring project results and delivery to determine if they are meeting desired results or not
techniques are used in order to ensure quality standards when a problem is identified.

## Key Concepts

Hereafter follows a compilation of key concepts needed for quality management.
For each concept it is provided a short description, example and/or further references.

**Key Concepts:**

- Continuous Improvements
- Planning, Assurance and Control
- Lean
- Six Sigma
- Agile
- House of Quality
- Pareto Analysis
- Quantitative Metrics
- Qualitatigve Matrics
- Testting, Audits and Inspections

Key approaches to try measurre project

| Key | Description |
|----|-----|
| Validations | Are we running the righ project? Are the stakeholders engaged with this project? Is there a motivation |
| Verification | Are we executing the project correclty? `|
| Precision | How well can we predict what the result of an action will be? How consistent something works or is. |
| Accuracy | How close have we come to achieving our goal ? |
| Tolerance | Are we doing well enought ? DOes the result falls into acceptable range ? |

Quality measurementgs allow to track project status and identify actions and processes which can be improved.


"Quality is free."
- Philip Crosby
(American Businessman)

Why. Because if you have poor quality it costs someone money. This is because poor quality can impact the companies product or is cost passed to the cuastomers.


Try:
1.  find areas where money can be safety saved
2. try new approaches to reducting costs

## Project Quality Management Phases

< TODO >

### Continuous Improvement

Makes quality a part of everyone's job and that should
improve project management.

1. Assess project plans: make sure to question assumptions and scope

2. Assess project management process: identify ways to 
reduce cost, improve efficiency, effective tracking, 
and provide more value

<!> small improvements can add up and leat to massive gains in the long run

### Quality Planning

Planning occur at the initial stages of project - the key objectives is to:
- define and limit the scope of work within the project
- develop a clear set of requirements to measure quality of project

Note that quality metrics defined in this project should only obe applicable in
this project.


Defines the scope, schedule, budget, inputs and outomts etc. It is the method to define the relevant aspects withih the projce.
Within planning stage it is also defined the critical aspects and factors that lead to successfull project.

Planning should include:
- Objectives
- scope
- policies
- criteria
- expected inputs and outputs
- cost, budge
- scheduling
- assumptions and considerations
- Processes
- Stakeholders, roles and responsibilities
- Applied standards (internal, external)
- metrics to measure quality

Each project should have a specific tracking and control proess - that is set before project starts.

<!> note: the quality planning process is part of a larger "project planning phase" which includes non-quality topics.

Outcome: THere should be documentation outlining the quality management plan  - and all the necessary quality informaiton. Thus inclides:

// IMportant
- "Determint quality": need to define twhat is quality for the project - this might vary from orfanization-to-org; and also between different projects.
- "Conduct gap analysis" 
- /// copy
Here, you identify the gap between where you are and where you need to be. This leads to the creation of a quality team, which is comprised of people across all departments and levels.
Define the roles and responsibilities for quality management: These people are accountable for each step in the quality management plan.
Establish Quality Control Procedures: Once you’ve defined what your quality standards are, you’ll need to establish procedures to measure whether those standards are being met or not, which is known as quality control.
Create acceptance criteria: This is tied to how you’ll do testing and review. Once you identify weaknesses, brainstorm with your team and integrate the needed quality improvements to your product or service.

### Quality Assurance

Next, project management needs to guarantee assurance on ongoing project:
- stick to the plan and follow processes correctly
- track progress towards deliverable
- monitor budget
- also include potential changes which improve the quality in our project.

### Quality Control

Quality control focuses on measuring and tracking the data from metrics previously agreed.
- includes all the measurements and controls which can applied to the project.
- includes measuring the results and outcomes of a project to ensure that they meet our requirements
- could involve testing, auding and certifications of products or processes

> Example: you want to make a Pizza
1. planning includes defining the task needs: ingrediaents, utelsiz, kitchen, oven
2. assurance includes making sure we follow the recipe, cleaning the kitchen
3. quality cointolr includes checking for the final result pizzza (taste, size, etc..)

## Methodologies and Frameworks

To be able to achieve the desired goal to manage the quality of
project effectively, there are a number of existing methodologies
and frameworks. Here is a summary.

### Applying Lean

Lean is a process developed by Toyota (toyota production systems)]

Why is important?
- use lean to elimitnate wsaste and crette efficientis in the delivery process

Goal of Lean : Improving efficienty by eliminating waste

- Gemba: go to the place where the task is performed
- kaizen: conduct a workshop to redesign a process and improve efficiency
- Muda: eight types of waste associated with current process
  - transportation
  - inventory
  - motion
  - waiting
  - overproduction
  - overprocessing
  - defects
  - skills
- Kanban boards: tracks the status of the project tasks
> backlog - ToDo - onGoing - Done

Order and organization is a part of minimizing waste - and managenent qwuality

5-S

> sort thing
> set in order
> shine (or clean them)
> standardize (process)
> sustain the new organiza

### Applying Six-Sigma in projects

it is a process improvement technique created around statistics and statistical process control metrics

> we want to reduce defects by minimizing the variabliity in the process and we can do this by using process DMAIC

Define : define what to do, process
Measure: select metrics for measurement
Analyze: check the results and identify sources of variability
Improve: improve the process (by selecting the best combiination of veriables)
Control: keep control over the selected improved process

This process focuese in industrial level HW and ddevelopments - but in theory should be applicable to any process defined including SW development

> objective: reduce variability -= in order to increase quality

#### Agile

The Agile framework is popular within the context of SW development. It tries to address known issues with traditional SW developement
methodologies: slow pace, costly, difficult to adapt to changing requirements and frustrating for SW development.
The [Agile Manifesto](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/the-agile-manifesto/) provide a new approach to manage SW projects,
focusing on people, communication and working SW rather than traditional process-heavy approaches.
Within this framework, teams are typically self-organized and work in small increments called sprints. This way it is possible
to accomodate any cange or 

Main Values:
* *Individuals and interations over processes and tools*
* *Working SW over comprehensive documentation*
* *Customer collaboration over contract negotiation*
* *Responding to change over following a plan*

another key aspect is that work gets done in smaller increments - called sprints
> mini-project with short timeline
> team working on each sprint is called a Scrum-team
> at the end of this sprint, this team delivers a finish product
> this means that both develoepment and testing needs to be completed
> this makes it easier to prioritize work and identify issues quickly

#### House of Quality

House-of-quality is a practise that helps to show the relationship between features and requirements - so we can make smart choices in the project.
The official name for this is "quality functional deployment" QFD (or HOQ, House-of-Quality).

House of Quality is a product planning matrix that is used to show how your customer requirements relate directly to the actions you can take to achieve those requirements. 
HOQ diagrams resemble the shape of a house and should be created using direct customer input if applicable. HOQ is considered the primary tool in QFD and serves as the roadmap for describing the journey from initial idea to final product or service specifics. 
This methodology is useful as it allows to identify which features of product or project are essentially to meet requirements - and maximize value created with the project.

Refs:[LucidChart-HoQ](https://www.lucidchart.com/blog/qfd-house-of-quality), [GeeksforGeeks-HoQ](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/house-of-quality-example-in-software-quality/), [isixsigma-HoQ](https://www.isixsigma.com/dictionary/house-of-quality/)

#### Pareto Analysis

Pareto analysis dictates (or statistically represents) the scenario where 80% of the errors or defects come as a results from 20% of the sources.
Using this principle we can try to identify the part of the work where quality changes can have the hightest impact.


#### Quantitative Metrics

Quantitative metrics allow to when we want objective understanding of what happens without the need for peoples opinions

> need to develop quantitative metrics for project
> generally quant data can measure a process or product
> what are you trying to measure - product characteristics? Amount of time to complete task? orthers
> if we cannot measure things directly, then the next best approach is 'proxy measurement'
> these metrics are only as useful as the process used to collect this data
> data needs to be as accurate as possible
> need also to think abou the precision when calculating metrics - do we round up or use 0.00x point precision?
> use graphs and charts to identify data and trends in data

#### Qualitative Metrics

Quality is subjective from person-to-person. We can use qualitative metrics to try to 'measure' oppinions
about the project activities and scope. This measures peoples opinion on the project, here are some examples:

* A/B testing -  binary options
* Ranges - using range value as options 1:10
* Interviews and surveys or listening to groups

#### Testing, audits and inspections

Typically, QA uses inpections and audits while QC uses testing.

* Inspections: observation and report of work processes
* Audit: like inspection but more formal review of errors and decifiencies
* Testing:L exammination of product to check if product complies with expected specs



##### What to avoid

- review and revise the quality plan throughout the project
- avoid big changes - better make small changes in increments
- stay objective
