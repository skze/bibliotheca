## Introduction

*What Is Project Quality Management?*


Project quality management is the process of defining quality standards for the deliverables of a project, as well as the quality assurance measures to guarantee those standards are met.

> Project Quality Management processes include all the activities of the performing organization that determine quality policies, objectives, and responsibilities so that the project will satisfy the needs for which it was undertaken. [4]


### Project

**Project Steps**

There are 4 main phases to the project-quality-tracking process. These include 1) planning, 2) control, 3) assurance and 4) improvement.

**Purpose**

The main objective of project quality management is ensuring that the team is working in the right direction to achieve the set goals. It focuses on quality aspects - which can be measured, tracked and analyzed.

Project managers further define these for their project through a quality management plan. A quality management plan is a document that helps project management teams establish quality planning, quality control and quality assurance procedures.

Within the context of project management, "quality" is simply what the customer or stakeholder needs from the project deliverables. Project quality management can be simply defined and measured in 3 key aspects:

- Quality planning: identified which 
- quality assurance
- quality control

Quality is measured by comapring the attributes of a product or service and the expectations. It is a subjectvie comparison because quality is often a selling poing

Within Project management context , qualityt is defined as the degree with which the project has meet its requirements.

Key Concepts:

- Continuous Improvements
- Planning, Assurance and Control
- Lean
- Six Sigma
- Agile
- House of Quality
- Pareto Analysis
- Quantitative Metrics
- Qualitatigve Matrics
- Testting, Audits and Inspections

Key approaches to try measurre project

| Key | Description |
|----|-----|
| Validations | Are we running the righ project? Are the stakeholders engaged with this project? Is there a motivation |
| Verification | Are we executing the project correclty? `|
| Precision | How well can we predict what the result of an action will be? How consistent something works or is. |
| Accuracy | How close have we come to achieving our goal ? |
| Tolerance | Are we doing well enought ? DOes the result falls into acceptable range ? |

Quality measurementgs allow to track project status and identify actions and processes which can be improved.


"Quality is free."
- Philip Crosby
(American Businessman)

Why. Because if you have poor quality it costs someone money. This is because poor quality can impact the companies product or is cost passed to the cuastomers.


Try:
1.  find areas where money can be safety saved
2. try new approaches to reducting costs

## Continuous Improvement

Makes quality a part of everyone's job and that should improve project management.

1. Assess project plans
> make sure to question assumptions and scope

2. Assess project management process
> identify ways to reduce cost, improve efficiency, effective tracking, and provide more value

<!> small improvements can add up and leat to massive gains in the long run

## Quality Management

Quality needs to be managed. It can be broken in 3 key aspects:

1. Planning
2. Assurance
3. Control

### Planning

Key aspect to planning is to limit
- limit and define well the scope of work
- develop a clear set of requirements to measure quality of project

### Assurance
- stick to the plan and follow processes correctly
- track progress towards deliverable
- monitor budget
- also included potential changes which improve the quality in our project.

### Control
- Includes all the measurements and controls which can applied to the project.
- includes measuring the results and outcomes of a project to ensure that they meet our requirements
- could involve testing, auding and certifications of products or processes

Example:
you want to make a Pizza
1. planning includes defining the task needs: ingrediaents, utelsiz, kitchen, oven
2. assurance includes making sure we follow the recipe, cleaning the kitchen
3. quality cointolr includes checking for the final result pizzza (taste, size, etc..)

## Quality Processes


### Quality Plannning

Defines the scope, schedule, budget, inputs and outomts etc. It is the method to define the relevant aspects withih the projce.
Within planning stage it is also defined the critical aspects and factors that lead to successfull project.

Planning should include:
- Objectives
- scope
- policies
- criteria
- expected inputs and outputs
- cost, budge
- scheduling
- assumptions and considerations
- Processes
- Stakeholders, roles and responsibilities
- Applied standards (internal, external)
- metrics to measure quality

Each project should have a specific tracking and control proess - that is set before project starts.

<!> note: the quality planning process is part of a larger "project planning phase" which includes non-quality topics.

Outcome: THere should be documentation outlining the quality management plan  - and all the necessary quality informaiton. Thus inclides:

// IMportant
- "Determint quality": need to define twhat is quality for the project - this might vary from orfanization-to-org; and also between different projects.
- "Conduct gap analysis" 
- /// copy
Here, you identify the gap between where you are and where you need to be. This leads to the creation of a quality team, which is comprised of people across all departments and levels.
Define the roles and responsibilities for quality management: These people are accountable for each step in the quality management plan.
Establish Quality Control Procedures: Once you’ve defined what your quality standards are, you’ll need to establish procedures to measure whether those standards are being met or not, which is known as quality control.
Create acceptance criteria: This is tied to how you’ll do testing and review. Once you identify weaknesses, brainstorm with your team and integrate the needed quality improvements to your product or service.
