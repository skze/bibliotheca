# ISO 9001
ISO 9001 sets out the criteria for a quality management system.
Using ISO 9001 helps ensure that customers get consistent, good-quality products and services,
which in turn brings many business benefits.

It is part of the ISO 9000 standard family.

Ref: https://www.iso.org/iso-9001-quality-management.html

## Introduction

ISO 9001 help build 'trust' by helping companies developing  and building Quality Management Systems (QMS)
up to global standards.
QMS is made of processes and documentation. A framework is put in place to monitor, verify and guarantee quality across the company.


## Concepts

ISO
 
 ### CONCepts
 #### Process approach: a way to think about your whole business in a process approach , inclu
 ng individuals, teams, services

- sources on inputs
- inputs
- activities / actions / work (machine work e.g.,)
- outputs
- receivers of outputs

> this methdolofy allows to understand and evaluate which ones are th ekey processes, which ones have the most impact, and which ones are the most revelenat for products and you r customeer.

> each process whould have a process owner - to kep track of sucess

#### Risk bases thinking
thinking in terms of risks and rewards - helps to drive all th edecision making.

ISO 9001 : requires a formal documented risk management process.

#### 3.4.2 PDCA Cycle
Plan > Do > Check > Act

quality is a consecutive plan for action

1st requirements of iso 9001 fall unser 'plan'
> Determine the context of your organization
> include influences: people, policites, regulations, facilitiees, anything that influences the business - any 'interested parties' - they form a web of connections which forms the influcences.

Quality systems depends on the context of business

'leadership' needs to take onwership of th quality process -it is at the center of this process - PDCA cycle.

top management holds several responsivilibities:
- nee to create your quaity policy: document that demonstrated your commitment to quality
- set objectives and delegate responsibilities
- review the system regurlarly and review resources needed for quality
- top management steers the ship

Next step is PLanning
- use risk-thinking to come up with objectives on how to address them.
- objectives need to be quantifyable - 'do better' is not a realistic objective
- leadership needs to provide resources, capaibilities, equipment and others

Communication and awaremess
- comms is a key priority of ISo 9001 and quality
-

Phase 2: Operations Control
> applies to anything that goes into creating your products and services
> "controls" are the steps taken to direct your processes towards the esired results
> by controlling risks we can avoid costly errors

?? but how do we know these controls are doing what they are supposed to do???
